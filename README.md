# Generalized Robotic Action models for Sensorimotor Policies (GRASP)

[Ongoing project]

Exploring robotic foundation models for general-purpose pick&place manipulation using lerobot and so101 as a part of student robotics club, iBot at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

## Goal
Most VLAs are data hungry even for simplest of learning and adaptation. Desire to explore data-efficient robot learning for general purpose pick and place manipulation. Will test on lerobot and so101.

## TODO
- Adapt base VLM. I use Llava Pythia as adapted in TinyVLA.
- Need to understand the base VLM adapted code and trim for minimal.
